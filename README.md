# Hey, Vinícius here ✌🏽
I'm a beginner programmer and focused on web development. My primary motivation to start programming was during this pandemic was an RPG I participated on discord, during the campaign I noticed that the general use bots weren't everything I expected, so I decided to build my own bot on python, using the now archived discord.py. After some weeks struggling to write some code with zero knowledge, I finally decided to read the documentation and this is when I truly fell in love with Python. Currently, I'm working on another project related to the bot on discord, willing to find a community to discuss.
